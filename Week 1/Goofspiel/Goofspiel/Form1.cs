        * HOW TO MODIFY THE GAME TO UPDATE THE COMPUTER'S STRATEGY 
        *   In order to modify the game, you should only need to update the method below, 
        *   computerPlayerMove(); The comments in the code should give sufficient direction.
        *
        * VARIABLES YOU MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE THE STRATEGY
        * There are two pieces of information you might wish to use in designing a new strategy:
        * 
        * a) the list of cards already played by the other player:
        *      this is held in the array Boolean humanPlayedCards[]
        *      this INDEX of the array specifies the card (0=Ace, ..., 12=King)
        *      Each item in the array has a boolean value true/false depending on 
        *      whether the card has been played. 
        * 
        *  b) The value of the current upturned card:
        *       this is stored in a variable: int upturnedCardValue
        *       (0=ace, .... 13=king)
         * * * * */

Each suit is ranked A (low), 2, ..., 10, J, Q, K (high).\n\n 1. One suit is singled out as \"competition\" suit (in this version, we use the HEARTS suit); each of the remaining suits becomes a hand for one player. The hearts are shuffled and placed between the players with one card turned up.\n\n 2. Play proceeds in a series of rounds. The players make \"closed bids\" for the top (face up) heart by selecting a card from their hand (keeping their choice secret from their opponent). Once these cards are selected, they are simultaneously revealed, and the player making the highest bid takes the competition card. In the case of a tie, the competition card is discarded and neither player scores (other variants of this rule are sometimes played, however are not included in this game).\n\n 3. The cards used for bidding are discarded, and play continues with a new upturned heart card.\n\n 4. After 13 rounds, there are no remaining cards and the game ends. Typically, players earn points equal to sum of the ranks of cards won (i.e. Ace is worth one point, 2 is two points, etc, Jack being worth 11, Queen 12, and King worth 13 points). \n\n\n In tnis implementation, the computer (clubs) plays with a fixed strategy coded into the program. The computer plays against a human (spades) who selects cards to play using the mouse\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n Press START to start a new game\n\n The computer automatically plays its card, the human player needs to click on a card to select the one they wish to play \n\n Click NEXT CARD to turn the next card in the deck for the next round \n\n Scoring is updated automatically";
